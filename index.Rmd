# I. Fundraising Principles


---
# What is Fundraising ?

> ## Fundraising is a process that aims to collect and distribute wealth in order to have a positive sustainable impact on a public cause. 




---


### 1. People Give To People To Help ~~People~~ __causes__

-----------------------------------

  + ### Fundraising is value-based

  + ###Donors will act based on the feelings they have with the final recipient.
  
  + ###Donors invest in projects with a positive impact.
  
  + ###Institutions do not have needs, causes have -> Mission Statement

--

## The Paradox of Generosity

+ ### People feel happier, richer, and healthier after donating time and money to others. 

---

### 2. People Give Relative To Their Means And To What Others Give
-----------------------------------

 + ### Avoid schemes based on the “average gift.”
 
 + ### Pyramidal Planning ensures that everyone can donate.

---

### 3. Those Closest To The Organization Must Set The Pace

--------------------------------------------------------

+ ### The leadership begins with the board, the staff and the key volunteers.

+ ### As an example:

---

### 3. Those Closest To The Organization Must Set The Pace

--------------------------------------------------------

## The Time-Ask Effect

+ ### If people are first asked to give their time to an organization, and only later asked to make a financial donation, they will give more of both (Lio and Aaker, 2008)

--

+ ### Thinking about money automatically activates concepts of individualism and self-focus (Vohs, Mead, and Goode, 2006)


---

## 4. The Six Rights 
-----------------------------------------------

### The six rights are the six critical success factors in any fundraising campaign.


.pull-left[

+ ### Who is the _right_  person that should ask for the contributions?
+ ### Determining the _right_  prospects.
+ ### What is the _right_ amount to request ?

]

.pull-right[
+ ### Choosing the _right_ project.
+ ### Determining the _right_ time.
+ ### What's the _right_ way ?

### Organizations with a fundraising plan are likely to raise more money (Nonprofit Research Collaborative, 2014)

", height = 500)

```

---

# The Vision Statement

+ ### The Vision is a clear statement of the world the nonprofit wants to see (Sargeant & Shang, 2010). 


+ ### It must define briefly what success will look like for the organization (Weinstein & Barden, 2017).


---

# The Mission Statement

+ ##The Mission Statement defines the mechanisms that will allow the organization to make its vision a reality.

 + ###Why does the organization exist ? 
 + ###Whom does it serve ?
 + ###What is the geographic range of its work ? 

---
# The Mission Statement


+ ##The Mission Statement must be formulated in a way that enables the organization to measure and evaluate its achievements.
